			<p><strong>Publish or Perish</strong></p>

			<p>I am postdoctoral fellow, and <a href="http://dbmi.ucsd.edu/confluence/display/BMI/Division+of+BioMedical+Informatics">my academic department</a> is currently
			running a junior faculty search.  We are interviewing four candidates, each of
			whom will present a job talk attended by the entire department.  Before each
			talk, I&#8217;ll receive each candidate&#8217;s application packets, and my eyes will scan
			the &#8220;publications&#8221; section of their resume.  The presence of a first-author
			article in the ultra-prestigious academic journals Science or Nature would all
			but guarantee an offer.  Multiple publications in top-tier journals would
			indicate a strong application.  If those are missing, meaning the publication
			history is weak, I&#8217;ll wonder how that person got an interview in the first
			place.  Cultural fit, letters of reference and other credentials certainly
			matter, but beyond publications, everything is secondary.</p>

			<p>To anyone involved in academia, this overwhelming focus on publications is a
			given.  Publishing is so central to scientists that their academic value can
			be measured by adding the relative worth of their publications.  After many
			years, citations preferentially accumulate towards publications of
			significance, and by extension, their authors.  Ranking importance by
			citations received is a powerful concept, and incidentally is the basis for
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">Google&#8217;s search algorithm</a>.  But at the beginning of an academic&#8217;s
			career, before citations accumulate, reputation rests largely on what journals
			they have published in.</p>

			<p>Getting a paper accepted into an academic journal requires passage through the
			often opaque process of peer-review. Scientists make a big deal of peer-
			review, because it is supposed to be the filter that separates mere opinions
			from trusted, citable sources. However, the peer-review process in science has
			close analogs in any &#8220;old-media&#8221; field, such as TV or radio. Like academic
			journals, these are mediums of limited capacity, and there are always more
			submissions (or ideas for submissions) than there are openings.  Selecting
			content worthy enough for distribution is made by the field&#8217;s establishment,
			which effectively silences what they don&#8217;t choose. This is especially true of
			peer-review as practiced in prestigious journals, defined as the ones that get
			their contributors faculty jobs.</p>

			<p>Having editorial decisions made by established experts makes sense, since they
			draw on judgement born from years of experience. But this exposes the system
			to vulnerabilities common to any decision by committee &#8211; especially semi-
			secret committee &#8211; such as lack of agility, an aversion to disruptive
			innovation, and the tendency of committee members (and their friends) to be
			more equal in their own eyes than anyone else.  Because publishing affects
			scientists so deeply, the strengths and weaknesses of this system inevitably
			affect the makeup and character of science as a whole.  Which makes one
			wonder, is there a better way?</p>

			<p><strong>GitHubbing</strong></p>

			<p>My training has spanned biology, engineering, and computer science.  My latest
			project, <a href="http://secure.dokbot.com/">Instant Q&amp;A for Physician Communities</a>, relies heavily on open
			source code and led me to <a href="http://www.github.com/">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>.  The Linux community
			<a href="http://progit.org/book/ch1-2.html">developed Git</a>, a distributed version control system, to coordinate work
			on the Linux code repository among thousands of programmers. Git is itself
			open source, and has become widely adopted for many software projects (open
			source and not).  GitHub is a cloud service that hosts <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/24/github-one-million/">over 1 million</a>
			Git repositories.  Since its launch in 2008, GitHub has quickly become the <em>de
			facto</em> platform for publishing open source code, whose popularity is changing
			the world.  If you&#8217;ve ever been astonished at how quickly the web world seems
			to move, the primary reasons are 1) it&#8217;s not dominated by Microsoft, so we
			have competition instead of a monopoly, and 2) open source code, widely shared
			through a multitude of email lists in the past and now centralized at GitHub
			[<a href="http://marciovm.com/i-want-a-github-of-science#f1n">1</a>].  How has GitHub become so successful?</p>

			<p>GitHub is a social network of code, the first  platform for sharing validated
			knowledge native to the social web [<a href="http://marciovm.com/i-want-a-github-of-science#f2n">2</a>].  This is a big deal.  I believe
			it represents a demonstrably superior way of distributing validated knowledge
			than academic publishing.  How are these even related?  Software developers
			rarely write applications from scratch.  Instead, they often start with
			various modular bundles of open source code.  Within Ruby (the programming
			language underlying the popular web application framework Ruby on Rails
			[<a href="http://marciovm.com/i-want-a-github-of-science#f3n">3</a>]) these bundles are called gems.  My current project employs 34 gems.
			Each one is responsible for a specific task, such as <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">logging in users</a>,
			<a href="https://github.com/marcel/aws-s3">interfacing with cloud storage</a>, or making <a href="https://github.com/imathis/fancy-buttons">fancy-looking buttons</a>.
			Science operates in a similar way.  Scientists never begin a research project
			from an intellectual vacuum.  They stand on the shoulders of giants, building
			on the knowledge contained in previous publications to form a new, coherent
			finding.  For example, the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/marcios/Marciovm+et+al+Analytical+Chem.pdf">article</a> in which I published the bulk of my
			PhD thesis cites 38 others.</p>

			<p>Gems are typically developed, distributed, and promoted through GitHub, and
			therein lies the connection.  GitHub has evolved to solve the same general
			problem that scientific publishing does: making modular, validated units of
			knowledge easily usable by a global community, with mechanisms that
			efficiently allocate prestige to proven contributors.  GitHub has the
			advantage of doing this with 21st century technology, the social web, while
			academic publishing is based on the printing press.  This suggests an
			opportunity for the scientific community to evolve its publishing practices by
			assimilating mechanisms proven to work for GitHub.</p>

			<p><strong>Published Versus Prestigious</strong></p>

			<p>The existing peer-review process <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=414579&amp;c=2">arose from the limited carrying capacity of physical journals</a>.  Prioritization had to happen before publication,
			because journals were limited in size to what could be economically printed
			and shipped.  If you were born before 1990, you may recall the prestige
			formerly associated with being &#8220;a published author&#8221;.  However, in the times we
			are living in, distributing media is basically free.  Anyone can start a blog
			and deliver content worldwide in minutes.  Clay Shirky has made a career of
			<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594202532/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=marciovm-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1594202532">deftly explaining</a> how this has fundamentally changed the media equation,
			with such unexpected consequences as YouTube videos that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OBlgSz8sSM&amp;feature=player_embedded">get more views</a>
			than Super Bowl commercials.</p>

			<p>Individuals still have a limited capacity for consuming and evaluating
			content, so prioritization and authentication remain necessary, but look
			different.  These functions are now disconnected from publication.  Google
			prioritizes web pages by analyzing utility <em>after</em> publication, by tracking
			citations in the form of inbound links.  Similarly, anyone can publish a gem
			to GitHub, and published gems are prioritized by the numbers of developers
			&#8220;watching&#8221; for updates or &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)">forking</a> &#8221; new development lines.  This is the
			social web at work, where the audience gets to decide what and whom to pay
			attention to all by itself, without requiring assistance from all-powerful
			editorial committees.  One can complain that lowering barriers to publication
			leads to content that on average is of lower quality.  But the abundance of
			non-significant projects in GitHub does not detract from its usability,
			because those projects are never brought to anyone&#8217;s attention [<a href="http://marciovm.com/i-want-a-github-of-science#f4n">4</a>].</p>

			<p>Prestige is really about having an engaged audience that follows and
			recognizes your activities.  This formerly required publication through
			established venues, but that&#8217;s no longer needed since your audience can use
			the social web to recognize and engage with you directly.</p>

			<p><strong>The Market for Prestige</strong></p>

			<p>Gems on GitHub are not just code.  They also have authors whose relative
			contributions are automatically catalogued by Git, as shown in this <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery/graphs/impact">impact graph</a> for the popular and open source jQuery project.  If you&#8217;ve visited
			a web application recently, chances are you&#8217;ve benefitted from jQuery, which
			makes it easy for a web engineer to turn static web sites into responsive web
			applications (think interactions with buttons instead of navigation through
			links).  This impact graph can let you know precisely which developers are
			responsible for this awesome-ness. In this way, GitHub acts as an efficient,
			incorruptible &#8220;central bank&#8221; of the prestige supply. Furthermore, unlike in
			Google, great contributions in GitHub bring prestige to their creators, not
			their domain names.  If you wanted to hire a contractor to work on a web
			application, GitHub can let you know who has publicly demonstrated the skills
			you&#8217;d need.  It&#8217;s thus not surprising that <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/careers-2-0-now-does-github/">GitHub profiles are supplanting traditional resume items</a>, such as a CS degree, for discerning employers
			looking to hire top talent.</p>

			<p>By contrast, current Open Science <a href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/Main_Page">efforts</a> that ask scientists to &#8221;<a href="http://figshare.com/">share all your data</a>&#8221; have not become mainstream, because they do not
			appropriately reward knowledge producers.  They are all free-distribution and
			no prestige, solving a different half of the problem than traditional journals
			but not the whole enchilada.  Put another way, when anything can be published,
			there is no prestige associated with being published, so prestige must be
			introduced in other ways.  Evangelists for Open Science should focus on
			promoting new, post-publication prestige metrics that will properly
			incentivize scientists to focus on the utility of their work, which will allow
			them to start worrying less about publishing in the right journals.</p>

			<p>The biomedical world is increasingly permeated by code and data [<a href="http://marciovm.com/i-want-a-github-of-science#f5n">5</a>],
			which should be very amenable to GitHub style metrics since they are by nature
			tied to networked computers.  Scientists in fields like genomics and
			biomedical informatics are being held to the same publication expectations as
			their peers, but this makes little sense.  An article describing a genomic
			database is nowhere near as useful as an open API for accessing it.  We need
			trusted ways to quantify just how useful that API and associated code are to
			the scientific community, which can be listed on a scientist&#8217;s profile and
			utilized by committees making hiring and funding decisions [<a href="http://marciovm.com/i-want-a-github-of-science#f6n">6</a>].</p>

			<p><strong>Challenges and Current Efforts</strong></p>

			<p>Of course, there are fundamental differences between publishing software code
			and publishing science.  Copying code results in an exact replica and does not
			affect the original.  By contrast, duplicating a research finding may require
			significant expenses just to recreate experimental conditions.  Code is
			structured by the strict syntax of programming languages, while most
			scientific research is not.  For this reason and others, academic articles and
			journals are not going to disappear, but they should not be the only way for a
			scientist to accumulate prestige.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, energy that could be spent developing these new solutions is
			instead tied up with the older struggle of open-access.  Universities still
			pay outrageous sums to journal publishers to allow them access to the
			knowledge they just produced, reviewed, and edited on their own dime
			[<a href="http://marciovm.com/i-want-a-github-of-science#f7n">7</a>].  Broadly speaking, traditional journals are being reduced to rent-
			takers on brand names with reputational inertia.  <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>, which provides
			open access to pre-prints in many quantitative disciplines, is a notable and
			<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/259/5099/1246">long-running</a> example of the scientific community&#8217;s workaround to this
			problem.  The arXiv is amazing, but why remain dependent on a system it could
			be replacing [<a href="http://marciovm.com/i-want-a-github-of-science#f8n">8</a>]?</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.plos.org/about/principles.php">PLoS</a> is at the cutting edge of both open-access and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dduin/rethinking-the-functions-of-a-journal-some-case-studies-from-plos-by-mark-patterson">rethinking the functions of a journal</a>.  <a href="http://www.plosone.org/">PLoS One</a> comes closest to what I am
			describing, in that their peer-review process screens only for scientific
			rigour, not perceived impact, meaning they will publish content considered
			unsexy and let future citations determine importance.  But they have not yet
			embraced the social web, as the lack of scientist profiles (with associated
			prestige metrics) in their website demonstrates.  In programmer jargon, PLoS
			ONE needs to become a web application, not a website that hosts content.  One
			problem might be that they still consider themselves a journal first, <a href="http://www.plosone.org/static/edboard.action">and journals have editorial boards</a>, while <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/110111/why-the-new-york-times-eliminated-its-social-media-editor-position/">social web is all about <em>not</em> having editors</a>.  There is no editorial board at GitHub.</p>

			<p>When I discuss this with current faculty, a typical reaction is that I&#8217;m
			pining for a social network of scientists.  That seems reasonable, and it is
			<a href="http://www.academia.edu/">being tried</a>, but may not be bold enough.  GitHub did not succeed by
			being a social network of programmers.  It succeeded by being a social network
			of code.  We need a social network of science, meaning scientific bundles of
			knowledge must be structured and accessible by API, with the connections among
			those bundles and appropriate utility metrics being what connects and
			prioritizes scientists.</p>

			<p>APIs for science already exist, and some are incredibly useful, but they have
			ignored authorship and prestige implications which have prevented them from
			achieving their potential.  For example, biophysicists have the <a href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/home/home.do">RCSB Protein Data Bank</a>, which stores experimentally determined protein structures.
			This database is a tremendous asset to the field, but it could represent much
			more, as a story from my younger days illustrates.  In 2004, as an undergrad,
			I spent a summer writing Python code to download and analyze all existing RCSB
			structures.  That program built a database of &#8220;real&#8221; structures to train a
			scoring algorithm, which subsequently scored computationally generated
			structures to see how &#8220;real&#8221; they seemed [<a href="http://marciovm.com/i-want-a-github-of-science#f9n">9</a>].  Unfortunately, my results
			were not compelling enough to be published in a prestigious academic journal,
			and therefore not interesting to my research adviser.  Open-sourcing and
			publishing that code might have saved someone&#8217;s time, spurred new thinking, or
			at the very least marked a tangible reward for my work.  But the incentives to
			my adviser weren&#8217;t there, so he did not suggest it.  That idea did not even
			occur to me, because I was not a good enough programmer to know about
			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>, a less-social precursor to GitHub, so the code went
			nowhere.</p>

			<p><strong>Hey Mr. Gates</strong></p>

			<p>It may be that the activation energy required to initiate changes won&#8217;t arise
			within the system.  In that case, an outside push might do the job, and the
			best place for this push to come from may be a nimble funding agency.  For
			example, a request for proposals could specify that phase II funding decisions
			would be based on the impact of online resources developed in phase I, as
			measured by specific metrics developed with community feedback.  Nothing makes
			a scientist contemplate change faster than a new source of grant money, and
			the only thing better than a faculty applicant with a paper in Science may be
			one bringing in a multimillion dollar grant.</p>

			<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

			<p><a name="f1n">1</a> &#8220;The combination of the Internet and open source transformed the
			functionality in modern programming tools, increasing developer productivity
			10 fold&#8221; - <a href="http://voices.allthingsd.com/20110323/bubble-trouble-i-dont-think-so/">Ben Horowitz</a>, formerly of Netscape.</p>

			<p><a name="f2n">2</a> &#8220;Native&#8221; in the sense <a href="http://www.usv.com/2009/06/the-mobile-chal.php">eloquently explained by USV</a> (the VCs who funded
			Twitter): &#8220;Native opportunities are the ones that make use of unique
			capabilities of [new] platforms&#8221;.  The social web is the new platform.</p>

			<p><a name="f3n">3</a> For example, Twitter, Groupon, and GitHub itself run on Ruby on Rails.</p>

			<p><a name="f4n">4</a> I speculate that many gems are also discovered through technical blogs
			(found through Google) or the programmer Q&amp;A site <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>.</p>

			<p><a name="f5n">5</a> Biomedical research is also huge - funding has been <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/303/2/137.full">squeezed lately</a>,
			but is still on the order of ~$100B annually.  Therefore the potential market
			is large enough to be worthwhile to build for.</p>

			<p><a name="f6n">6</a> The unique requirements of the scientific community probably mean GitHub
			itself can&#8217;t do the job.</p>

			<p><a name="f7n">7</a> Or more accurately, on the federal government or philanthropic organizations
			that fund them. Journals do not compensate their editors or peer reviewers.</p>

			<p><a name="f8n">8</a> The peer-review process <a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Sept06/library_arXiv.html">has been hacked via arXiv before</a>, by Grigori
			Perelman.  But to appreciate how unusual Grigori&#8217;s motivations are, consider
			that he also refused to accept the Fields Medal and its $1M cash prize.</p>

			<p><a name="f9n">9</a> Computing protein structure from amino acid sequence is known as &#8220;the
