Consider administration of the two vaccines separated by at least 4 weeks.</p><p>Serious vaccine-related adverse reactions<br />that have occurred following vaccination with ZOSTAVAX include asthma exacerbation and polymyalgia rheumatica. Other serious<br />adverse events reported following vaccination with ZOSTAVAX include cardiovascular<br />events (congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema). Common adverse reactions occurring in ≥1% of vaccinated individuals during<br />clinical trials include injection-site reactions (erythema, pain/tenderness, swelling, hematoma, pruritus, warmth) and headache.</p><p>Transmission of vaccine virus may occur between vaccinees and susceptible contacts.</p><p>Deferral should be considered in acute illness (for example, in the presence of fever) or in patients with active untreated tuberculosis.</p><div><p><strong>Before administering ZOSTAVAX<sup>&reg;</sup> (Zoster Vaccine Live), please read the <a href="https://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/z/zostavax/zostavax_pi.pdf">Prescribing Information</a>.</strong></p></div><p class="shift small"><sup>a</sup><strong>Study Design:</strong> Subanalysis of data from the 2007 National Immunization Survey-Adult (NIS-Adult), a national telephone survey sponsored by the CDC to obtain detailed information regarding adult vaccination coverage.

Of the 3,235 respondents unvaccinated for zoster, 77.8% said they would get the vaccine if recommended by their doctor.</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><p>1.
