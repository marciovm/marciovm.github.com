I'm a healthcare IT consultant. I recently completed a PhD in bioengineering at MIT, where I built a solid-state biosensor for early-cancer diagnosis.  I'm passionate about applying technology to medicine.  

I was born and raised in Porto Alegre, Brazil, and currently live in San Francisco, California.
